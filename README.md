ATM Machine Project
Overview
This project is an implementation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in [programming language]. 
The ATM system provides essential functionalities such as withdrawing money, checking the PIN, depositing money, and exiting the system.

Object-Oriented Design
The project follows a modular and object-oriented design, making use of classes and encapsulation to organize the code into manageable components.
